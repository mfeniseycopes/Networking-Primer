# Networking-Primer

A introductory networking primer based on my notes from the [Networking for Web Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/networking-for-web-developers--ud256) course by [Udacity](http://udacity.com).

## How to use

Well, you don't really use it, but if you are brand new to networking, start from the beginning. Otherwise, just read what tickles you.
